## Objective
Instacart wants to uncover more information about their sales patterns. Perform an initial data and exploratory
analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

## Context
The *Instacart* stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database
along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same
methods, and they’re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different
customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale
of their products. The analysis will inform what this strategy might look like to ensure Instacart
targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products. 

## Stakeholders
- ***Vice President of Marketing:*** *“We’re always looking into improving our targeting for ad campaigns.”*
- ***Senior Vice President of Sales:*** *“We need to know what part of our offering has the lowest market share and why. Based on this input, we could improve this sector and boost sales.”*
- ***Instacart Customer:*** *“I want to receive ads, promotions, and recommendations that are relevant to the products I order regularly.”*
